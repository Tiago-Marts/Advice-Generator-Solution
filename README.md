## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge tells us that users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development and Conclusion

I want to use more CSS Grid than Flexbox when dealing with layouts, I think that the result would probably be way more accurate if I use it more. Also I find Grid more confortable to deal with responsivity. 

In futures challenges I want to start using React and Vue more again. I already know how these tools works, but it's always good to practice it.

In general it was a very fun challenge! And probably I spent more time in the stylization than I should.

### Useful resources

- [Utopia - Fluid Space Calculator](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/)- This is pretty helpful when trying to implementing responsivity in font size.
- [Working with JSON and Javascript - Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) - I still forget a thing here and there while working with JSON, so I'm always with this documentation at my side. The same goes to CSS and JS itself.
